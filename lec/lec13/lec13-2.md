# Java 8 Shortcuts for Anonymous classes, Part 2: The "method reference" expression.
Java has created two shortcuts that can be used for creating anonymous classes in the special case that the class is implementing an interface that contains a single method stub.

Just as the "lambda syntax" shortcut is not a true programming language lambda, the "method reference" is not truly a method reference.

It is written to -appear- as if we are passing a method as input to another method, but that is not what is happening. Instead, the "method reference" is effectively another form of an anonymous class.

## The "method reference" shortcut for anonymous classes
Consider the following anonymous class:
```
	b.setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {
	   public void handle(ActionEvent e) {
	      reset();
	   }
        });
```
where `reset` is a private method:
```
	private void reset() {
	   -- code to reset the application --
	}
```
In this case, the method we are overriding is simply calling another method.
On one hand, this leads to a simple "lambda" shortcut:
```
	b.setOnAction(e -> {reset()};);

      However, if we change the other method so that it's input parameters are identical to the anonymous class method:

	b.setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {
	   public void handle(ActionEvent e) {
	      reset(e);
	   }
        });
```
	where reset is a private method:
```
	private void reset(ActionEvent e) {
	   -- code to reset the application --
	}
```
Then we can use the "method reference" shortcut:
```
  b.addActionListener(this::reset);
```
Note the syntax.
* To the `right` of the :: is the `name of the method our anonymous class method will call.`
* To the `left` of the :: is the `object or class that we will call the method on.`
* So, you can think of "this::reset" as being the same as "this.reset"; however, the __`::` makes it clear we are using the shortcut.__
  * Java will effectively __replace the "this::reset" with an anonymous class__ and its __only method will call `this.reset` with the same input as was passed into the anonymous class function.__
