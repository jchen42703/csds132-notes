# A way to use threads to test your JavaFX application

If we want to call `new Button()`, we must first call `Application.launch()`, but `Application.launch()` does not return! We can get a workaround by having a thread call `Application.launch()` so the interactions pane (or the `JUnit` test code) will be free to do other things.

One catch is that `Application.launch()` must be called from a `static` method that is inside a class that extends Application.  It cannot be called from another class like Thread. So, we make such a method, and then have the thread call that method:
```
        public static void launchApp(String[] args) {
           Application.launch(args);
        }
```
Now here is a method that launches the JavaFX application in a thread:
```
        public static void launchInBackground(String... args) {
           Thread appThread = new Thread() {
              public void run() {
                 launchApp(args);
              }
           };

           appThread.start();
        }
```
Now we can run:

> `SimpleApp.launchInBackground();`

to run launch the application but still have the main thread to run other tests or code in.
