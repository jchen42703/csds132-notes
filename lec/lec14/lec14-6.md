# Jar Files

In this short lesson, we demonstrate how to create a jar file on DrJava.
- You first must create a project with the java files of your program.
- You can then create a jar file.  You should indicate that the jar file is executable, and you should input which class has the main method.

The jar file is just a collection of Java class files.  (It can contain source files, too, but that is not needed for the jar file to work.) We typically collect programs and libraries into a jar file, and then we can share the jar file with others without having to send all the java and class files. On most systems, a user can just click on an executable jar file to run the program.
