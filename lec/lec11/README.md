# Module 11: Nested Types, Anonymous Classes, Exceptions

* [11-1: Sorting, Comparator, and an Intro to Nested Classes](lec11-1.md)
* [11-2: Non-static Nested Classes](lec11-2.md)
* [11-3: Anonymous Classes](lec11-3.md)
* [11-4: Review and Generics with Static and Non-Static Nested Classes](lec11-4.md)
  * Note: I combined this with lec11-5 because it was also review and discussed generics with nested classes.
* [11-class: Exceptions](lec11-class.md)
  * Goes over checked (`try/catch`) and unchecked exceptions with examples
