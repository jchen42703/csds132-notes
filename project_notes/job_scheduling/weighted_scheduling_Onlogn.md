* For scheduling jobs with `{startTime, endTime, profit}`

## Algorithm
1. Sort the jobs by non-decreasing `endTime`
2. For each `i` from `1 to n`:
  * determine the max of `jobs[0..i]`
    * compare the inclusion of `job[i]` to the schedule to the exclusion of `job[i]` to the schedule -> Take the max.
    * To find the profit with inclusion of `job[i]`. we need to find the latest job that doesnâ€™t conflict with `job[i]`. The idea is to use Binary Search to find the latest non-conflicting job.
