# Non-static Nested Classes

In this lesson we are going to create a `Comparator` for `Employee` as a non-static nested class.
The comparator will order `Employees` based on how close their salary is to one Employee (namely "this" `Employee`).

Creating a non-static nested class is the same as any nested class except that we do not use "static".

__However, there are a couple of rules you need to be aware of:__
1. The non-static nested class __has access to the `this` of the containing class.__ This is the instance of the containing class that "owns" this non-static nested class.

2. __Inside an instance method of the non-static nested class, there are two "this" values__, the "this" that is the instance of the non-static nested class that the method is running on, and the "this" that is the instance of the containing class that the non-static class is "inside".

__When you use "this", you are referring to the instance of the nested class.__
If you want to be specific about which instance you want, you __have to put the type before the this.__

__For example, we created__
```
	   private class CompareSalaryToThisEmployee implements Comparator<Employee> {
        inside the Employee class, so

	    this                                 -> the instance of CompareSalaryToThisEmployee
	    Employee.this                        -> thie instance of Employee
 	    CompareSalaryToThisEmployee.this     -> the instance of CompareSalaryToThisEmployee
```
3. When creating an instance of the non-static nested class, you must __first create the instance that this nested class instance will "belong to".__
  * The syntax for the creation takes a little to get used to:
  ```
  Employee e = new Employee("Harold", 10000)     
  Employee.CompareSalaryToThisEmployee c = e.new CompareSalaryToThisEmployee()     

  Notice the unusual "new" operator!
  ```
